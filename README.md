# Data-Visualization of International Footbal Results

Hi Football Lovers, This is an analysis and data visualization about football results of National Teams, inspired by a dataset I found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017) by Mart JÃ¼risoo . This dataset includes 41,586 results of international football matches starting from the very first match in 1872, up to 2020. So, I hope you will enjoy this work. I also encourage you to leave a comment below, any tips or consideration will be really welcomed. 

I exploited python and its main libraries to extract from the dataset the national teams the history of football has declared successful. For my Visualizations, I exploited seaborn, matplotlib and plotly.express libraries

I used the away goal decision rule to pick a winner for matches that didn't end in a goalless draw when creating the Winner and Loser columns.

As an African, I also created visualizations for the Africa Cup of Nations and Africa Cup of Nations Qualification Tournaments, so as to know some history about these competitions. I also created visuals on history of football of my great country Nigeria.
